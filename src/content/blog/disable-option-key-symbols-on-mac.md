I recently discovered that Mac users have the ability to easily type out various symbols using `⌥ + <letter>` combinations (that's the symbol for the Option key). For example,
 
- `⌥ s` inserts `ß` at cursor, and 
- `⌥ w` inserts `∑` at cursor.

[Here](https://mackeeper.com/blog/special-characters-mac-keyboard/) is a list of these symbols and their trigger. However, this wasn't a feature I wanted or needed on my keyboard[^1].

I dug around for a little longer than expected, but finally came across a nice solution to disable the `⌥ + <letter>` combinations. See [here](https://superuser.com/a/942256) for the solution along with an explanation. However, I will copy and paste the gist of it here

[^1]: I use a non-standard keyboard, and these Option-key symbol combinations might accidentally get triggered if I'm being a little sloppy about how I type - this is how they're getting in the way in the first place 🙃
