I now have a little corner on the interwebs all to myself. I'm planning to use this space as a way
to record things that I learn that I want to save for my future self, or perhaps for others who
might stumble upon my blog.

This website is built by me with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and 
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It's been a
lot of fun learning basic frontend skills, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this website grows
overtime! If you're curious, check out the source code
[here](https://github.com/pcheng17/blog.petercheng.me). I am always happy to receive feedback!

This was inspired by the work of many others, in no particular order:
- Bonsoon's [blog](https://blog.bonsoon.net/), from which I am shamelessly stealing much of my inspiration
- Simon Boehm's [blog](https://siboehm.com/)
- Shawn Wang's essay, [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)
- Austin Kleon's [Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)
- Josh Branchaud's [repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) aptly named "Today I Learned"
