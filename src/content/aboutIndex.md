Hey there! My name is Peter Cheng, a mathematician and software engineer. I currently work at Roblox
on the physics engine team. In a nutshell, we make sure physics works as expected across the
platform. Previously, I worked on the FX/CFX production software team, with a focus on the
proprietary fire/gas and hair simulation engines. You can find my name in the credits of all of
the DreamWorks' films between 2019 and 2022!

I received my PhD in mathematics from UCLA, where I did research in the field of numerical analysis.
I'm also passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with those around me, which is the
inspiration for this website!

When I'm not working, I dabble in a lot of projects:

- I'm a part-time computational consultant for the [Segura Lab](https://seguralab.duke.edu/) at Duke University. I work with various members of the research team in developing software for analyzing the void space of packed particles.  
- I'm very interested in this AI revolution that we're experiencing with GPT and related technologies, so I often spend my time building small apps that allow me to experiment with GPT. I
would love to hear about the ideas you have!  
- This website, which serves two purposes: (1) it encourages me to document things I've learned to
more easily share with others, and (2) it has allowed me to learn some basic frontend and backend
skills via [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).  
- I also try and keep up with my Korean
studies as much as I can. 근데 시간이 많이 없다~ ㅠㅠ
